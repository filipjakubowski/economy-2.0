###Economy 2.0
#Quest for better Tomorrow

##The Challenge


<p>
Money as we know is great invention and plays important roles in our economy like for example: medium of exchange, unit of account and store of value. Origins of money are distant in time and money as we know them now have came from china where the first paper document become a standard of deferred payment, evidence of liability representing debt to someone. They played a great role in accelerating our economy and transformations through thousands of years to a world we know,  making easier to exchange goods and specialize in different areas making it possible to exchange services for verity of goods and other services.

 The value of money is based only on trust and belief in their potential as we cannot eat them, drive them or wear them. Only we (people) between ourselves are giving them power that they have and we strengthen desire to have more of them, as they can reflect our position in society, evidence of being successful and not being bounded to troubles of daily life. FIAT currencies like US dollar or Euro have their value and supply regulated by systems like governments and banks issuing it. Trust in those organisations and structures can reflect their value, stability, inflation of those currencies and are expressed in how much we can buy for them. In modern times we spent major part of our life working or planning to get more and more of money and some of us are strongly incentivise to create passive income not to need to work or provide additional effort and still being given more.

There are few ways of getting more money. We can provide the service for someone who will pay for it, sell goods, dividends, share from profit or receive a benefit from government or other organisation or individual. For most people who don’t have enough resources to invest or trade and they have not inherited wealth their main source of income is give their hands to labour market. There are few major challenges we know. One of them is to provide the ability to have decent job to people. For many this is a privilege. Privilege that with time is becoming more of an importance. More and more tasks are replaced by robots and there is growing amount of people who would like to compete for them. There are many regions where there is not enough work and people have to migrate to find one. Governments and unions are protecting businesses and work positions, even if there is no reason or advantage of keeping them. There are multiple ideas how to protect people who do not have income and give them chance to have a decent life. One of them is General Basic Income ( or  Guaranteed Minimal Income  ) that gives role to government to support all families in an income that will allow them to fill their basic needs. There are few important question around GBI – one is: How government can afford it and second is how it will impact people who are given this income. Will they be still productive and motivated, will they contribute to society or they will just sit at home in from of their TV’s, social medias or VR sets. There is growing amount of research around this and more willing to experiment and learn.

If we will try to take it step forward and dive into the feature. Let’s imagine that we live in world where machines and computers can provide most of resources that we need and food or place to live is not a challenge anymore. That 3D printing allowed everyone to have house and car of their dreams, we travel by drones on daily basis, we have our base on Mars, we power our cities from renewable energy, genetic modification extended our lives and technological enhancements boosted our senses and abilities. Funny thing… It is not so hard to imagine all od that that… It is all happening right now. But how we will our daily life will look like in this future? Should we still need to earn and spend money? Maybe we should consider more Star-Trek like civilization? Those questions were echoing in my head for quire some time now and all the challenges of economy and human limitations are making it extremely complex problem. There may be no easy way, or no simple solution for it but it does not mean that you or me should not try to get closes we can get. Lets try to unlearn from we know from world around us and just take it as a hint – one of the possible solutions, paths that mankind have took, and then we are ready for a deep dive.

On a quest for better tomorrow I had initially an idea… Idea that is interesting concept how we can approach Economy 2.0. Idea that I will reveal little later and I want to explain why. More precise I have been, more focus I have become on this single solution. Then I had  a though… what if I am all wrong. What if my time that I will submit to this single solution will be wasted – what if there are other, better solutions that I may never discover or think about. That was a moment when I tried to scrap my concept to core, to vison and goal only. The goal that can be like a destination not only for me, but for others, and maybe together we can find multiple solution and pick the best one. The perfect world I see is a world when person gets up in the morning and they are happy and motivated to provide services for others in both short and long term and they will care for our planet, others, animals and environment. 
</p>
The goals should be simple:
•	Everyone should equal opportunities 
o	to become amazing person
o	develop their skills
o	contribute is society
•	System should take care of basic needs and distance from having to work to survive
•	People should be motivated to contribute for others and world around us
</p>
<p>
This will not be an easy journey, but I  am inviting you to join, challenge yourself and world around you – how can better tomorrow look like? The first step is to define and concept and then challenge it from different angles. The best ideas can be tested and can become a template for governments and communities to implement. 
This document and initiative is to create platform, community and toolset to collaborate on those ideas together. To learn, experiment and share. We have ability to make live of next generations better, more engaging, productive and happy.
